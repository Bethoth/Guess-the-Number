Welcome in Guess the Number! This is a game where the computer chooses a random number and you must guess it!

There are 5 levels of difficulty:
1. Very easy: the number is between 1 and 10
2. Easy: the number is between 1 and 20
3. Medium: the number is between 1 and 50
4. Hard: the number is between 1 and 100
5. Very hard: the number is between 1 and 250

At each of your tries to guess the number, the computer will give you a clue to guess it.
You lose if you don't guess the number before the computer has given you the 10th clue.
